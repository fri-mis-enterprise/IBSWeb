## [v3.0.3] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- Added `EmployeeNumber` to the Filpride supplier master file so employee-category suppliers can store the employee reference directly in the supplier record.

### Changed
- Migrated Filpride employee-advance voucher flows to use `FilprideSupplier` records with `Category = Employee` as the standard payee foreign key instead of the separate employee linkage.
- Updated check voucher liquidation and related employee-advance selection flows to resolve employee advances through supplier-backed employee records.

### Removed
- Removed the check voucher `EmployeeId` linkage in favor of the standard `SupplierId` relationship plus an explicit employee-advance marker.

---

## [v3.0.2] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed
- Fixed Filpride customer order slip create and update flows to always persist `TotalAmount` from `Quantity * DeliveredPrice` instead of using the posted form value, preventing mismatched totals when the client-sent amount is stale or incorrect.

---

## [v3.0.1] - 2026-06-05

### Changed
- Added shared 4-decimal rounding helpers to the Filpride report controllers so derived numeric values can be normalized consistently before export.
